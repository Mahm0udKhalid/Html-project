Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence 
in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.<br>
 The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated
 with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</br>
Understanding Artificial Intelligence
When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first 
thing they usually think of is robots.<br>
That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like 
machines that wreak havoc on Earth.</br> 
But nothing could be further from the truth.

Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way<br> that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks,
 from the most simple to those that are even more complex.</br> The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.

As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example,<br>
 machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition</br> are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, 
 since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.<br>

AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based in mathematics,
 computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more.</br>
